/**
 * Content layer for the Classes browser: for each configured source it fetches the public
 * channel/playlist page and the RSS feed, merges them, applies the catalog filters, and
 * caches the result — falling back to the last-known cache (flagged via
 * [ChannelSection.refreshFailed]) when nothing can be reached, so a network blip degrades to
 * stale content rather than an empty screen.
 *
 * Why two sources rather than one:
 * - The **page** ([YouTubePageParser]) is the only key-free source of *duration* and the only
 *   listing that carries the members-only signal (a per-tile badge the feed has no equivalent
 *   of), so both catalog filters depend on it. It also carries roughly twice as many videos
 *   as the feed.
 * - The **feed** ([AtomFeedParser]) is the only source of exact publish timestamps (the page
 *   only says "4 months ago"), and it still works if YouTube changes its page internals.
 *
 * Page entries win on content; feed entries contribute their exact timestamps where the ids
 * match. If the page can't be read, the feed alone drives the row with durations unknown —
 * degraded filtering, but a working catalog. Only when both fail does the row go stale.
