/**
 * Keeps a rolling automatic backup of the whole database (feedback: "save user data locally
 * so when the app is updated there is no data loss") — the existing manual Back Up button
 * only helps if someone remembers to press it.
 *
 * On [start]:
 * 1. If the database is completely empty (fresh install / cleared data) and a previous
 *    automatic backup is readable, restore it silently — an update should feel like nothing
 *    happened.
 * 2. Then watch [dataChanges] and rewrite the automatic backup [debounceMs] after things
 *    settle, so every finished ride and profile edit lands in the backup without writing
 *    mid-burst.
 *
 * An empty database never overwrites the stored backup (see [writeBackupUnlessEmpty]) —
 * that one rule is what makes the whole thing safe, since the dangerous case is a launch
 * where the data is missing *and* the restore didn't take (unreadable file, storage
 * hiccup): writing then would replace the last good backup with nothing.
 *
 * Other failures are swallowed by design: an automatic safety net must never crash the app
 * or block a ride; the manual backup/restore path remains for deliberate recovery.
